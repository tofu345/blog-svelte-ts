- DONE: Create Login page
- get token using simple jwt
- Save token in local storage

- If token does not exist in local storage then redirect to login page 
- Also implement - (if you are redirected to login from a page when done logging in redirect back to the page using searchparams)

- Signout functionality delete token from localstorage if it is there and redirect to login page


------------------
- attach token to all requests
- make all views login required
- token duration to 7 days

- Instead of deleting mark and not deleted and delete after 30 days automatically
