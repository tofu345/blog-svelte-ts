Change the way the frontend - backend connection works
have the modal for the create post component be inside it

------------------
- DONE: Create Login page
- DONE: get token using simple jwt
- DONE: Save token in local storage

- DONE: If token does not exist in local storage then redirect to login page 
- DONE: Also implement - (if you are redirected to login from a page when done logging in redirect back to the page using searchparams)

- DONE: Signout functionality delete token from localstorage if it is there and redirect to login page


------------------
- DONE: attach token to all requests
- DONE: make all views login required
- DONE: token duration to 7 days

- Instead of deleting mark and not deleted and delete after 30 days automatically
- Paginate posts (20 at a time)

- Your Posts should be collapsable
